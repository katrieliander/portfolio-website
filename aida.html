        <p>As part of my CareerFoundry Certified UX Designer intensive course I designed Aida - a healthcare and wellness app native for iOS. I was tasked to create an expert app that enables users to chat with experts in any field, and from that
          Aida was born. </p>
          <p>I wanted to tackle the challenges around healthcare. Finding a suitable doctor can be at times very difficult, especially for instance if one lives in a foreign country and doesn't speak the local language. Aida was designed to be a holistic healthcare solution where it's convenient and quick to find a suitable practitioner.</p>
<p> I was the solo designer on this project so I created the design on my own, all the way from research to a finished prototype. You're welcome to click through the prototype or read further to discover my entire design process behind it!</p>

        <h3>The product</h3>
        <p>The goal of Aida is to make healthcare more convenient and comfortable for women. On Aida users can connect through video calls or chat with female practitioners in various healthcare fields, from GPs to gynecologists and ayurveda
          therapists to wellness coaches. </p>
        <h3>Target audience and the challenge it solves</h3>
        <p>Aida is for all women that are looking for a convenient way to take care of their health and wellness. For the modern, busy woman, Aida provides a holistic healthcare solution. Users can now forget about long waits at doctor's offices or
          seeing practitioners that don't listen to them - on Aida all practitioners treat patients with respect, understanding and a holistic approach.</p>
        <h3>My role</h3>
        <p>I worked as a solo designer on this project. I was responsible for all steps throughout the process, all the way from ideation to the final prototype.</p>

        <p>Finding a doctor can be difficult. It can be very time-consuming to find a suitable practitioner and sometimes you might end up with a doctor that just doesn't get you. This can be especially true for women. Women can feel uncomfortable turning to unfamiliar doctors with their most intimate issues and questions. Also, in today's modern world where most people are busy balancing work, family and social life, we long for solutions that will make our lives easier and more convenient.
From this the initial thought of Aida - as a holistic and convenient healthcare solution - emerged.</p>

            <h3>Competitive analysis</h3>
            <p>To get started, I had to get to know the market and the other players out there. I noticed that there are a few popular apps that connect users with doctors, and I chose two of them for a SWOT analysis.
<b>KRY</b> is a Swedish company that in recent years has expanded to other European countries. <b>Maven Clinic</b> is an American company. </p>
<h4>Insights from competitor analysis</h4>
<p>From the analysis I discovered that there is indeed a gap on the market for a well-functioning, holistic healthcare and wellness app specifically aimed for women. Maven Clinic only operates in USA and it
is lacking some functionalities related to choosing a doctor based on certain criteria. KRY on the other hand is very focused on quick availability but lacks the human approach and the ability to choose your practitioner.</p>

            <h3>User research</h3>
            <p>After I had gotten to know the market, the next step was to get to know the potential users. I wanted to understand their behavior around healthcare and their biggest frustrations, wishes and challenges related to it. I decided to conduct a <b>quantitative survey and 5 in-person
                interviews</b> to get an understanding both on the width and depth. In the end I conducted several rounds of affinity mapping to group the findings and get a full understanding what they really meant.</p>

The user personas helped me to empathize with the user and my target audience. Based on the user personas and their needs, I was able to create user journeys and user flows for each persona.</p>

                  into the task, was a suitable solution. The sitemap was refined with the help of an <b>open card sorting</b>. 10 participants took part in the card sort.</p>

              <h3>Sketching</h3>
              <p>I started the designing process by sketching out ideas with pen and paper. I sketched wireframes for the key functionalities and screens that were presented in the user flows:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Find and message a practitioner</li>
                <li>Go to scheduled call & book the next call</li>
                <li>Leave a review for a practitioner</li>
              </ol>
              <p>From the sketches, the screens slowly started to take shape. After sketching, I moved to creating mid-fidelity wireframes in Balsamiq and thereafter in Adobe XD.</p>
            </div><!-- end sketching block-->
            <div class="narrow margin-bottom">
                <h3>Navigation</h3>
                <p>I chose a bottom tab bar as navigation. The navigation includes four tabs: Home, Find care, Messages and My profile. The sitemap transformed in quite a straightforward way to the navigation. The five main categories from the
                  sitemap were incorporated in the navigation. In addition to these, "Messages" was included in the navigation. This enables the user to easily and quickly navigate to all important areas of the app.</p>

              <p>Finally it was time to test my prototype with real users. The goal of the user tests was to evaluate the key functionalities and features of the app and observe how users interact with the app. I wanted to see what users find
                challenging with the app in order to further improve the design. The tests took in average 30 minutes. I specified <b>five test objectives</b> based on the key functionalities. I created direct as well as scenario questions in order
                to test them. I wanted to see for instance whether users knew where to navigate in order to leave a review. It was very exciting to see how users interacted with the first prototype!</p>
                <h4>Affinity map & Rainbow spreadsheet</h4>
                <p>I organized all my findings first in affinity maps. Thereafter I summarized the 30 key findings from the tests in a Rainbow spreadsheet. I used Jakob Nielsen's scale from 1 to 5 to evaluate the severity of each error or improvement
                  idea.</p>

              <h3>From feedback & own learnings to new improved iterations</h3>
              <p>Most participants completed the five tasks quite easily and effortlessly, and no major usability errors were discovered. The tests revealed things that the participants, however, felt a bit hesitant or confused about. Participants
                also came with good improvement ideas and suggestions.</p>
              <p>Based on the user feedback and observations, a few bigger improvements were made. Users had for instance felt confused about the payment structure on the app. These issues were evaluated as critical and improved immediately.</p>
              <p>After the user tests, further iterations were made before the final mockups were reached. I also invited fellow students to review my work and give feedback.</p>
                <h4>Improvement #1: Filtering & sorting</h4>
                <p>A couple of users wished to be able to filter also by price and first availability. These options were added as filters and also as sorting options. The amount of matching practitioners was also added to the button. In the final
                  design, the sorting has been separated from the filtering to make it easier for users to access it.</p>

              <h4>Improvement #2: Profile of practitioner</h4>
              <p>Based on user feedback price, next available appointments and current work place were added to the practitioner profile. The buttons were locked so that they are always visible to the user. Tabs for "About" and "Reviews" were added
                to have a clear and easy way of presenting reviews.</p>

                            <h4>Improvement #3: List of practitioners</h4>
                <p>Users wished to see more information (price, amount of reviews and first availability) in the list view. These were added for each practitioner.</p>
                <p>In the final design, the filter has been moved down on the screen and the sort function is located on the opposite side of it. There they are easily visible to the user. In the user tests a few users didn't see the filter option
                  when it was located in the top right corner.</p>

              <div class="narrow margin-bottom-double">
                <h4>Improvement #4: Home page</h4>
                <p>A few test participants stated that for them the focus of the app felt a bit unclear on the home screen and they weren't sure how to proceed in order to connect with someone.</p>
                <p> Two users said that the notification on the top of the screen felt a bit pushy and the search field in the middle felt out of place.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The search field was moved on top of the screen as then it's equally located on both the home screen and the "Search" screen. This way users find it in the same place across screens. </li>
                  <li>The call reminder was placed under the name as there it's more connected to the name and creates a small personalized section on the home screen.</li>

        <div class="narrow">
        <p>Working on this project was a huge learning experience to me. It was the first time that I designed a mobile app, all the way from start to a working prototype. Considering that this was my first proper UX design project, I'm very satisfied with the end product. Here are a few of the key learnings from this project.</p>
        <h4>What went well:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li style="padding-bottom: 20px"><b>Valuable insights from user research:</b> I’m pleased with the way that I managed to translate my user's needs and challenges into a design that helps to solve them (one of my user's said in the usability test that she really wishes this app actually existed!). With the help of my user research and user personas, I  was able to create clear user flows & journeys that made sense for the personas. These flows provided valuable guidance in creating the structure and IA of the app.
</li>
          <li style="padding-bottom: 20px"><b>UI design:</b> I’m satisfied with the final UI design. As someone with no prior experience in UI design, I think I was able to create an interface that is attractive and joyful to use. It also conveys the Aida brand image that I had in mind for the product.
</li>
          <li style="padding-bottom: 20px"><b>Iterating after user testing</b>: The user tests gave me valuable feedback for improving my prototype. However, in the future, I will test my design even earlier in the design process. This will help me to minimize the time that I waste on design details that I might anyway iterate on after the user's feedback.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>What didn't go well / What can I improve:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li style="padding-bottom: 20px"><b>Testing earlier:</b> As I already mentioned, I could have tested my design with users even earlier. I spent quite a lot of time on small details on my mid and high fidelity wireframes, even though I ended up changing them many times after that. So to make my design process smoother and more efficient in the future, I will make sure to first confirm the structure and layout with the help of user tests, and only after that proceed to designing high-fidelity wireframes. </li>
<li style="padding-bottom: 20px"><b>Limitations in user research:</b> I would have liked to do a more extensive user research in the beginning of the project but this wasn't possible due to the time and budget limitations that I faced. With more time and resources, I would have conducted more interviews to deepen my understanding about the target audience.</li>
