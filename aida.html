        <p>As part of my CareerFoundry Certified UX Designer intensive course I designed Aida - a healthcare and wellness app native for iOS. I was tasked to create an expert app that enables users to chat with experts in any field, and from that
          Aida was born.</p>
        <h3>The product</h3>
        <p>The goal of Aida is to make healthcare more convenient and comfortable for women. On Aida users can connect through video calls or chat with female practitioners in various healthcare fields, from GPs to gynecologists and ayurveda
          therapists to wellness coaches. </p>
        <h3>Target audience and the challenge it solves</h3>
        <p>Aida is for all women that are looking for a convenient way to take care of their health and wellness. For the modern, busy woman, Aida provides a holistic healthcare solution. Users can now forget about long waits at doctor's offices or
          seeing practitioners that don't listen to them - on Aida all practitioners treat patients with respect, understanding and a holistic approach.</p>
        <h3>My role</h3>
        <p>I worked as a solo designer on this project. I was responsible for all steps throughout the process, all the way from ideation to the final prototype.</p>

        <h3>Understanding the problem</h3>
        <p>Finding a doctor can be difficult. This is especially true if you for instance live in a country where you don't speak the local language or you are looking for a specialized doctor. It can be very time-consuming to find a suitable practitioner and sometimes you might end up with a doctor that just doesn't get you. This can be especially true for women. Women can feel uncomfortable turning to unfamiliar doctors with their most intimate issues and questions.</p>
<p>Also, in today's modern world where most people are busy balancing work, family and social life, we are always looking for solutions that will make our lives easier and more convenient in some way.</p>
<p>From this the initial thought of Aida - as a holistic and convenient healthcare solution - emerged.</p>

            <h3>Competitive analysis</h3>
            <p>To get started, I had to get to know the market and the other players out there. I noticed that there are a few popular apps that connect users with doctors, and I chose two of them for a SWOT analysis - KRY and Maven Clinic. </p>
              <p>KRY is a Swedish company that in recent years has expanded to other European countries. Maven Clinic is an American company.</p>
            <p>From the competitive analysis I discovered that there is indeed a need on the market for a well-functioning, holistic healthcare and wellness app specifically aimed for women..</p>

                  into the task, was a suitable solution. The sitemap was refined with the help of an <b>open card sorting</b>. 10 participants took part in the card sort.</p>

              <p>I started the designing process by sketching out ideas with pen and paper. I sketched wireframes for the key functionalities and screens that were presented in the user flows:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Find and message a practitioner</li>
                <li>Go to scheduled call & book the next call</li>
                <li>Leave a review for a practitioner</li>
              </ol>
              <p>From the sketches, the screens slowly started to take shape. After sketching, I moved to creating mid-fidelity wireframes in Balsamiq and thereafter in Adobe XD.</p>

                <h3>Navigation</h3>
                <p>I chose a bottom tab bar as navigation. The navigation includes four tabs: Home, Find care, Messages and My profile. The sitemap transformed in quite a straightforward way to the navigation. The five main categories from the
                  sitemap were incorporated in the navigation. In addition to these, "Messages" was included in the navigation. This enables the user to easily and quickly navigate to all important areas of the app.</p>

                    <p>Therefore I chose to present the healthcare fields first on the main "Find care" screen. From there the user can navigate to the desired field, filter practitioners, continue to the profile and choose to

                  <p>This flow was designed primarly with the <b>persona Sofia</b> in mind. It is for the user that wishes to build a long-term relationship with a specific practitioner and perhaps book calls with that practitioner on a regular
                    basis. </p>
                    <p>The flow starts with a notification about the upcoming call and after the call the user is presented with the option to book a new call.</p>

              <h3>User tests</h3>
              <p>Finally it was time to test my prototype with real users. The goal of the user tests was to evaluate the key functionalities and features of the app and observe how users interact with the app. I wanted to see what users find
                challenging with the app in order to further improve the design. The tests took in average 30 minutes. I specified <b>five test objectives</b> based on the key functionalities. I created direct as well as scenario questions in order
                to test them. I wanted to see for instance whether users knew where to navigate in order to leave a review. It was very exciting to see how users interacted with the first prototype!</p>

                <p>I organized all my findings first in affinity maps. Thereafter I summarized the 30 key findings from the tests in a Rainbow spreadsheet. I used Jakob Nielsen's scale from 1 to 5 to evaluate the severity of each error or improvement

              <h3>From feedback & own learnings to new improved iterations</h3>
              <p>Most participants completed the five tasks quite easily and effortlessly, and no major usability errors were discovered. The tests revealed things that the participants, however, felt a bit hesitant or confused about. Participants
                also came with good improvement ideas and suggestions.</p>
              <p>Based on the user feedback and observations, a few bigger improvements were made. Users had for instance felt confused about the payment structure on the app. These issues were evaluated as critical and improved immediately.</p>
              <p>After the user tests, further iterations were made before the final mockups were reached. I also invited fellow students to review my work and give feedback.</p>

                <p>A couple of users wished to be able to filter also by price and first availability. These options were added as filters and also as sorting options. The amount of matching practitioners was also added to the button. In the final
                  design, the sorting has been separated from the filtering to make it easier for users to access it.</p>

                <p>Based on user feedback price, next available appointments and current work place were added to the practitioner profile. The buttons were locked so that they are always visible to the user. Tabs for "About" and "Reviews" were added
                  to have a clear and easy way of presenting reviews.</p>

                <p>In the final design, the filter has been moved down on the screen and the sort function is located on the opposite side of it. There they are easily visible to the user. In the user tests a few users didn't see the filter option

                <p> Two users said that the notification on the top of the screen felt a bit pushy and the search field in the middle felt out of place.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The search field was moved on top of the screen as then it's equally located on both the home screen and the "Search" screen. This way users find it in the same place across screens. </li>
