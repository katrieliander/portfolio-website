            <p class="blue">A little bit about me</p>
<p>I'm originally from Finland but my desire for new adventures brought me to Berlin 3 years ago. My curiosity has taken me all around the world and so far I have lived in 5 countries. It's finally in Berlin where I dared to make my career transition into UX design.</p>
<p>My first coffee in the morning, good food, sunsets, long walks, yoga, exploring new places and conversations with friends are things that bring me joy in my everyday life.</p>

<p class="blue"> Why UX Design?</p>
<p>Since I was little I have been interested in human behavior and in understanding why people act the way they do. My mum says that I didn't stop asking "why" when I was a child. </p>
<p>In my previous roles I had several touch points with UX design, and I've always been very attentive to issues related to usability. So when I started learning more about the field, I immediately felt like it was the right match for me. I love how UX design perfectly combines creative and analytical work.</p>

  <div class="col-md-6 col-lg-6">
<p class="blue">How does my background strengthen me as a UX designer?</p>
  <p>I studied Economics and Marketing, whereafter I worked +5 years in SEO, mainly in the e-commerce field. SEO is about driving traffic to a website but after all, it's all about providing a good user experience. </p><p>As a SEO specialist, I have been optimizing landing pages to provide relevant search results for user's search queries, reduced image sizes to speed up websites and made sure HTML elements are semantically correct - all of which are equally relevant and important for UX design. Together these two practices help shape digital products that bring value for both the user and the business.</p>
  </div>
      <div class="col-md-6 col-lg-6">
        <p class="blue">What I can bring</p>
      <p>I combine my expertise in design and marketing to help grow digital products and enhance user experience. I bring strategic problem-solving skills that tackle problems both from the perspective of the user and the business.
         <p>As a designer, I'm motivated by people - I wish to design digital experiences that have a positive impact on people's lives and that solve real-life problems.</p>

<p>Determined and hardworking is the phrase that comes to mind when I think about Katri. I’ve had the pleasure of being Katri’s UX design mentor, during her UX design course at CareerFoundry. Above all, I was impressed with Katri’s curiosity and tenacity to keep iterating her designs until she’s found the right solution. This, along with her easy-going personality made it a pleasure to work with her at CareerFoundy. I believe Katri will make a great designer because of her positive mindset and willingness to keep working until she’s found an appropriate solution. She would be a true asset for any positions requiring UX design and visual design and she comes with my wholehearted recommendation.</p>

educated herself alongside her job, and she achieved splendid results doing so. Due to her good powers of comprehension, she quickly found her way into any area of tasks.

  <p>In her work Katri has shown her ability of sharp
    thinking, understanding not only the big picture but also the nuances of customer’s business allowing her to plan,
    coordinate and execute her work in high efficiency with extraordinary results...For example she created and coordinated a PR campaign related to travel industry which got the customer’s message through to all of the biggest newspapers in Finland. With my current knowledge I would hire Katri
    back instantly given the chance.</p>
