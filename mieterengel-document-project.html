        <p>MieterEngel helps tenants solve rental problems online. Members gets access to the MieterEngel portal (web app) where they can directly connect with their personal lawyer by asking questions to any rental problem. They can choose to be consulted by phone or request the lawyer to write a written report.</p>
</div>
  <div class="narrow">
        <h3>The background & context</h3>
        <p> The consultation flow starts with the customer submitting a question in the portal. The customer is required to type a message and often the lawyer needs some case related documents (e.g. rental contract, utility bill, termination letter). The customer can either upload existing documents or take photos of documents with the camera function in the web app and upload them that way. </p>
<p>Before the question is passed on to their lawyer, the service team reviews the request. If some important documents are missing, the service team contacts the customer via e-mail and asks them to upload the necessary documents. When new documents are uploaded, the service team reviews the message again and if everything is correct, they forward the request to the lawyer.</p>
<h3>The problem</h3>
<p>The initial problem statement came from our <b>internal service team:</b></p>
<p><i>”Often important documents are missing from customer’s questions which leads to much back and forth between the customer and the service team. Another problem is that customers very often upload single images that we need to merge before forwarding the message to the lawyer. These steps are time consuming for us and also result in longer waiting times for the customers.”</i></p>
        <h3>My role</h3>
        <p>I worked together with our product manager on this project. We worked together on user research, analysis and concepting. I was responsible for the wireframing and designs.</p>

        <div class="narrow margin-bottom">
        <p>Our first discussions with the service team made it clear that the biggest issues were: </p>
          <p><b>1. Single image uploads by customers </b></p>
          <p>The main source for this problem we could verify immediately. The problem with the normal upload function is that each file/image selected (most often from the phone’s camera roll) is uploaded separately. This can lead to customer messages with up to 50 single images attached. The service team then has to merge these images together to documents that make sense for the lawyer.</p>
<p>Why a problem? Results in one of the most time-consuming tasks for the service team.</p>
          <p><b>2. Important documents missing from customer questions</b></p>
          <p>At this stage we could only make assumptions why customers didn't upload needed documents. Our guesses were that they might either forget or that they are not aware that they should attach this/these document(s).</p>
<p> Why a problem? Results in time-consuming steps for both service team and customers. 
</div>
<div class="narrow margin-bottom-double">
            <h3>Research</h3>
            <p>The next step after discussing and getting insights from the service team, was to do user research in order to really identify the main paint points. As our target audience was both the service team and the customers, the user research phase included several steps in both qualitative & quantitativ research:
              <ul>
                <li>Hotjar recordings (see how customers behave on doc upload screens)</li>
                <li>Customer calls (call customers that had uploaded single images and ask them why)</li>
                <li>Tracking with GA (to understand the ratio of uploads on desktop vs. mobile and upload vs. camera app) - is a solution mostly needed on mobile or equally on desktop.</li>
                <li>Actual customer data (we looked through 150 customer cases to see how they have uploaded)
                  </ul>
<h4>Insights from research</h4>
<p>From the analysis I discovered that there is indeed a gap on the market for a well-functioning, holistic healthcare and wellness app specifically aimed for women. Maven Clinic only operates in USA and it
is lacking some functionalities related to choosing a doctor based on certain criteria. KRY on the other hand is very focused on quick availability but lacks the human approach and the ability to choose your practitioner.</p>

            <p>After I had gotten to know the market, the next step was to get to know the potential users. I wanted to understand their behavior around healthcare and their biggest frustrations, wishes and challenges related to it. I decided to conduct a <b>quantitative survey and 5 in-person
                interviews</b> to get an understanding both on the width and depth. In the end I conducted several rounds of affinity mapping to group the findings and get a full understanding what they really meant.</p>

                <p>I chose a hierarchical structure for the sitemap. The app will have a few main functionalities but it won't be too complex. Hence, a <b>hierarchical structure</b> with a couple of main pages that allow the user to proceed deeper
                  into the task, was a suitable solution. The sitemap was refined with the help of an <b>open card sorting</b>. 10 participants took part in the card sort.</p>

              <h3>Sketching</h3>
              <p>I started the designing process by sketching out ideas with pen and paper. I sketched wireframes for the key functionalities and screens that were presented in the user flows:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Find and message a practitioner</li>
                <li>Go to scheduled call & book the next call</li>
                <li>Leave a review for a practitioner</li>
              </ol>
              <p>From the sketches, the screens slowly started to take shape. After sketching, I moved to creating mid-fidelity wireframes in Balsamiq and thereafter in Adobe XD.</p>
            </div><!-- end sketching block-->
            <div class="narrow margin-bottom">
                <h3>Navigation</h3>
                <p>I chose a bottom tab bar as navigation. The navigation includes four tabs: Home, Find care, Messages and My profile. The sitemap transformed in quite a straightforward way to the navigation. The five main categories from the
                  sitemap were incorporated in the navigation. In addition to these, "Messages" was included in the navigation. This enables the user to easily and quickly navigate to all important areas of the app.</p>

              <h3>User tests</h3>
              <p>Finally it was time to test my prototype with real users. The goal of the user tests was to evaluate the key functionalities and features of the app and observe how users interact with the app. I wanted to see what users find
                challenging with the app in order to further improve the design. The tests took in average 30 minutes. I specified <b>five test objectives</b> based on the key functionalities. I created direct as well as scenario questions in order
                to test them. I wanted to see for instance whether users knew where to navigate in order to leave a review. It was very exciting to see how users interacted with the first prototype!</p>
                <h4>Affinity map & Rainbow spreadsheet</h4>
                <p>I organized all my findings first in affinity maps. Thereafter I summarized the 30 key findings from the tests in a Rainbow spreadsheet. I used Jakob Nielsen's scale from 1 to 5 to evaluate the severity of each error or improvement
                  idea.</p>

              <h3>From feedback & own learnings to new improved iterations</h3>
              <p>Most participants completed the five tasks quite easily and effortlessly, and no major usability errors were discovered. The tests revealed things that the participants, however, felt a bit hesitant or confused about. Participants
                also came with good improvement ideas and suggestions.</p>
              <p>Based on the user feedback and observations, a few bigger improvements were made. Users had for instance felt confused about the payment structure on the app. These issues were evaluated as critical and improved immediately.</p>
              <p>After the user tests, further iterations were made before the final mockups were reached. I also invited fellow students to review my work and give feedback.</p>
                <h4>Improvement #1: Filtering & sorting</h4>
                <p>A couple of users wished to be able to filter also by price and first availability. These options were added as filters and also as sorting options. The amount of matching practitioners was also added to the button. In the final
                  design, the sorting has been separated from the filtering to make it easier for users to access it.</p>

                to have a clear and easy way of presenting reviews.</p>

                <p>In the final design, the filter has been moved down on the screen and the sort function is located on the opposite side of it. There they are easily visible to the user. In the user tests a few users didn't see the filter option
                  when it was located in the top right corner.</p>

                <p> Two users said that the notification on the top of the screen felt a bit pushy and the search field in the middle felt out of place.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The search field was moved on top of the screen as then it's equally located on both the home screen and the "Search" screen. This way users find it in the same place across screens. </li>

        <p>Working on this project was a huge learning experience to me. It was the first time that I designed a mobile app, all the way from start to a working prototype. Considering that this was my first proper UX design project, I'm very satisfied with the end product. Here are a few of the key learnings from this project.</p>
        <h4>What went well:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li style="padding-bottom: 20px"><b>Valuable insights from user research:</b> I’m pleased with the way that I managed to translate my user's needs and challenges into a design that helps to solve them (one of my user's said in the usability test that she really wishes this app actually existed!). With the help of my user research and user personas, I  was able to create clear user flows & journeys that made sense for the personas. These flows provided valuable guidance in creating the structure and IA of the app.
</li>
          <li style="padding-bottom: 20px"><b>UI design:</b> I’m satisfied with the final UI design. As someone with no prior experience in UI design, I think I was able to create an interface that is attractive and joyful to use. It also conveys the Aida brand image that I had in mind for the product.
</li>
          <li style="padding-bottom: 20px"><b>Iterating after user testing</b>: The user tests gave me valuable feedback for improving my prototype. However, in the future, I will test my design even earlier in the design process. This will help me to minimize the time that I waste on design details that I might anyway iterate on after the user's feedback.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>What didn't go well / What can I improve:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li style="padding-bottom: 20px"><b>Testing earlier:</b> As I already mentioned, I could have tested my design with users even earlier. I spent quite a lot of time on small details on my mid and high fidelity wireframes, even though I ended up changing them many times after that. So to make my design process smoother and more efficient in the future, I will make sure to first confirm the structure and layout with the help of user tests, and only after that proceed to designing high-fidelity wireframes. </li>
<li style="padding-bottom: 20px"><b>Limitations in user research:</b> I would have liked to do a more extensive user research in the beginning of the project but this wasn't possible due to the time and budget limitations that I faced. With more time and resources, I would have conducted more interviews to deepen my understanding about the target audience.</li>
