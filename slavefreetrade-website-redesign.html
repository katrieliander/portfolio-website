        <p><b>slavefreetrade</b> — a Swiss non-profit that helps companies and organizations ensure their supply chains are free of modern slavery — needed a new website design. The old website was uninformative and users found it confusing - they weren't
          sure what the NGO actually is about when they browsed the website. Also, the look of the site was outdated. </p>
        <h3>Goal</h3>
        <p>The goal for the MVP was to create a responsive website that can generate business leads and that includes a few basic functionalities such as a donation possibility and a contact form. The look of the website had to also align with the evolving brand.</p>
        <h3>Scope and timetable of the project</h3>
        <p>The timetable for the project was tight as a MVP of the website needed to be ready and live for an online event that was held four weeks after the project properly started.
          The project included creating the information architecture and the wireframes for the website. The user research had already been done.</p>
        <h3>My role & the team</h3>
        <p>Team: Jia Yin Loon (designer), Noorida Mohd Ismail (designer), Katri Eliander (designer), Sara Simoncini (UI), Nneka Edozien (developer). Throughout the project we also worked closely with the marketing department.</p>
        <h3>Tools</h3>
        <p>Figma, Miro, pen & paper </p>

            <h3>The challenge</h3>
            <p>The old website only consisted of one page and it also had an outdated look.
            The old website was also missing a lot of information about the product and service that slavefreetrade offers and the information that was there was presented in quite an unclear way. Users had mentioned in user tests that
              another designer (Michael Lausberg) had conducted a few months prior, that:
              <ul>
                <li>Based on the website it's difficult to understand what the product is and does.</li>
                <li>It's unclear what slavefreetrade is.</li>
                <li>The website feels overwhelming as there is too much text.</li>
              </ul>
              <p> Below is a screenshot of the old website.</p>

              <img src="img/slavefreetrade/old-website@2x.jpg" class="smaller-image center" alt="slavefreetrade old website"></picture>
<p>The main target group had been defined based on the earlier research as heads of SMEs. Even though one side of the product is for the consumers, the main focus at this stage were businesses. Below is the IA that we defined for the website. Due to time constraints, we had to leave out the blog and the volunteer page from the MVP.</p>

              <h3>Moodboard & style</h3>
              <p>As the timetable was so tight, we jumped right in to brainstorming and deciding on the style and mood of the website.
              The old website was seen as too industrial and cold. We wanted the new website to be more human-centered, communicating warmth and trust. We set up a moodboard with stock photos that put across the desired mood and message. This helped
                us to vision how the new website should look like.</p>

            <h2>Wireframing</h2>
          </div><!-- end header block-->
          <div class="narrow"><!-- open text block-->
            <p>As we were three designers working with the website, we divided the work so that we each got specific pages to work on. However, we were all involved in the design work of all the pages as we collaborated so closely. Throughout the
              design process, we shared our work with it each other daily to give and receive feedback, and to make sure our designs worked together. As the deadline was so tight, we started almost immediately with mid and high-fidelity wireframes. Below I will present the wireframe that I was responsible for.</p>
              <h4>The business landing page</h4>
              <p>I worked on the landing page for businesses. The main purpose of the page is to briefly present the product "Libertas" - a tool that helps monitor and detect human rights violations within supply chains - and create business leads.
            The marketing department provided some text content in the beginning of the design process so we got an understanding of the content layout of the website.</p>

            <h3>Iterations</h3>
            <p>Below are iterations of the business landing page. The one on the left is one of the first ones, the one on the right is the final version. Our UI designer got involved later on in the project and helped out with the UI elements and
              details. The biggest changes were: </p>
            <h4>1. Order of content</h4>
            <p>In the first version the three stages of the process were presented first, whereafter some key facts of the product were shown. In the final version the brief information and facts about the product were moved to the top so that the
              user immediately gets an overview of the product, before learning about the three stages.</p>
            <h4>2. Amount of content displayed</h4>
            <p>Initially the three testimonials were presented underneath each other. The testimonials section was changed later to a slider to make the page look less content-heavy.</p>
            <h4>3. Removal of the contact form</h4>
            <p>The idea to have the contact form and the request demo function on the same page came initially from the marketing department. After thinking more thoroughly about the user journey and the primary action we wanted from the user, we
              decided to move the contact form to a separate page as getting demo requests was the primary action we wanted from users. It would also have been confusing for the user to have the contact from and request demo functions next to each
              other.</p>

                    <h2>Final thoughts and learnings</h2>
                  </div>
                    <div class="narrow">
                    <p>I was super excited to start this project as it was my first "real" design job and also the first time I worked as a UX Designer as part of a design team and a cross-functional team with a developer and the marketing people. It was a really good learning experience and I enjoyed the project a lot. However, as with every project, we faced some minor challenges.</p>
                    <h3>The challenges of the project</h3>
                    <p>The main challenge was the tight deadline. All of us had also just joined slavefreetrade so it was our first time working together. The entire design team at slavefreetrade had actually been established a few weeks prior and therefore there weren't any processes set in place yet. Because of this it took a while for us to understand each others strengths, skills and way of working.</p>
  <h3>What I learnt from this project</h3>
  <p><b>1. Good groundwork pays off</b></p>
  <p>As the timetable for the project was so tight, we dived head first into the design work without proper groundwork. If we would have reserved a bit more time in the beginning to brainstorm, ideate, iterate and set up a proper design process, we would have actually saved time in the end.</p>
  <p><b>2. Always start with sketches and low-fidelity wireframes - even though the deadline is tight</b></p>
  <p>There is a reason why a designer should start by sketching and doing low-fidelity wireframes. We jumped almost right into doing high-fidelity wireframes because of the time pressure - however, the work would have been more efficient if we would have had the patience to first establish the structure and layout of the pages and only after that started playing with colors and images. Now we ended up going back and forth with the UI design several times which slowed down the process.</p>
  <p><b>3. Many designers in one project brings a large skillset but comes also with its challenges</b></p>
  <p>We were three UX designers working primarly with the project but we also had a UI designer and a design director who got involved in the end. All of us brought together a broad mix of skills that is very valuable but especially when the deadline is tight, it might end up slowing down the process.</p>
  <p><b>4. It's your job as a Designer to clearly communicate and motivate your decisions</b></p>
  <p>During the project I understood how important communication is. I, as a UX Designer, have to be able to clearly explain and motivate why I have made certain decisions. I also have to be confident with and argument for my design decisions even though I might face some resistance.  It's not the responsibility of the other stakeholders to understand your decisions and designs, it's your responsibility as a Designer to explain them so that they get understood.</p>
