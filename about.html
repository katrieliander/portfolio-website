<p>I'm from Finland but my desire for new adventures brought me to Berlin 6 years ago. My curiosity has taken me all around the world (so far I have lived in 5 countries) and it also lead me to make my career transition into product design 4 years ago.</p>
<p>Since I was little I have been interested in human behavior and in understanding why people act the way they do. My mum says that I didn't stop asking "why" when I was a child. In my previous roles in SEO and digital marketing, I had several touch points with usability topics and my marketing background only makes me a stronger designer.</p>
<p>I approach design with a holistic approach and always think about optimizing user experiences end-to-end. I enjoy digging into data and analytics as much as I do getting creative and sketching ideas. I love how as a UX designer I can combine both creative and analytical work.</p>
<p>My first coffee in the morning, good food, sunsets, long walks, yoga, exploring new places and conversations with friends are things that bring me joy in my everyday life.</p>

            <p><i>Katri was quick to take up design ownership of a variety of different projects after joining the product team. She has a very level-headed and analytical approach to UX/UI. She reached out to users and ensured the user journey would work from start to finish. Working as a small team at a startup, I most valued her holistic thinking and hands-on mentality. Whenever needed, she questioned product requirements, independently set up analytics and evaluated data or set up A/B tests. On more than a few stories, she took up full product ownership herself. Within the engineering team, she was highly regarded for her ability to deliver crystal clear and easy to understand hand-offs, visual QA skills and concise communication in the delivery process. Stay curious Katri!</i></p>

<p><i>Determined and hardworking is the phrase that comes to mind when I think about Katri. I’ve had the pleasure of being Katri’s UX design mentor, during her UX design course at CareerFoundry. Above all, I was impressed with Katri’s curiosity and tenacity to keep iterating her designs until she’s found the right solution. This, along with her easy-going personality made it a pleasure to work with her at CareerFoundy. I believe Katri will make a great designer because of her positive mindset and willingness to keep working until she’s found an appropriate solution. She would be a true asset for any positions requiring UX design and visual design and she comes with my wholehearted recommendation.</i></p>

  <p><i>In her work Katri has shown her ability of sharp
    thinking, understanding not only the big picture but also the nuances of customer’s business allowing her to plan,
    coordinate and execute her work in high efficiency with extraordinary results...For example she created and coordinated a PR campaign related to travel industry which got the customer’s message through to all of the biggest newspapers in Finland. With my current knowledge I would hire Katri
    back instantly given the chance.</i></p>
