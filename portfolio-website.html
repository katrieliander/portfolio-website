        <p>To get a better understanding of what actually happens after the UX and UI Designers job is done - and the work is handed over to a developer in most cases - I decided to take a frontend course to learn and practice HTML, CSS and
          Javascript. </p>
        <h3>Challenge</h3>
<p>The challenge was to build this responsive website to showcase my UX Design work. I wanted to enhance my frontend skills to become more confident with cooperating with developers in the future and familiarize myself with industry-standard systems. </p>
        <h3>Tools</h3>
        <p>Atom, Codepen, GitHub, Adobe XD, W3C Validation Service</p>
              <h3>Development process</h3>
              <p>I started by defining the structure and the page elements with HTML, whereafter it was time to incorporate styling and layout with a <b>CSS stylesheet</b>. I decided to go with a fixed header that would always be visible for the user when scrolling. </p>
<p>I had from the very start a <b>mobile-first approach</b> in my design and development process, and I used <b>media queries</b> to define how content should be displayed and elements styled at medium and large viewports.
I also practiced doing some <b>CSS animations and transitions</b>. For the mobile version I wanted a hamburger menu for which I used <b>JavaScript</b>.</p>
<p>Below are the first sketches I did for the main landing page and the about me page for desktop and mobile views.</p>

          <div class="narrow margin-bottom">
            <h3>User testing</h3>
            <p>An important step in any design or development project is user testing. I wanted to test my website with 5 users to identify possible usability issues and get feedback on my portfolio site.</p>
            <h4>My test objectives were:</h4>
            <ol>
              <li style="padding-bottom: 20px">Observe how effortlessly users are able to navigate the website - do they immediately know where to go for what information?</li>
              <li style="padding-bottom: 20px">Find out any possible usability issues.</li>
              <li style="padding-bottom: 20px">See what kind of impression the website and the copy gives of me as a Designer. Does the website showcase my skills and me as a Designer clearly?</li>
            </ol>
            <p>I used <b>four scenario tasks</b> and <b>four open ended questions</b> to conduct my user studies. The usability tests didn't reveal any usability issues. All participants completed the tasks easily and quickly. However, the users had some other valuable feedback about copy and content that I acted upon.</p>
          </div>
                    <div class="narrow">
<h3>Code quality, accessibility & cross-browser testing</h3>
<p>The last thing I did before the launch of the website was to quality check my code and test it across browsers and devices. I used the linters <b>W3C Validator, linter-stylelint and Standard Javascript style</b> to check the code quality on my HTML, CSS and JavaScript files. I did some minor fixes in my code to remove identified errors or warnings. I also used atom-beautify to help format my code.</p>
<p>The <b>accessibility</b> of my UI elements such as buttons and text links I checked with the color checker and they both passed the <b>AAA compliant</b>.</p>
<p>Lastly I did a quality assurance test in the form of cross-browser testing. I found mainly some minor spacing issues that I fixed.</p>

            <h2>Final thoughts and learnings</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="narrow">
          <p>After a steep learning curve in frontend development skills, I am ready with my website. I had some challenges on the way but with the help of my mentor and Youtube I managed to build a website that I'm happy with. </p>
          <h4>A few key learnings from this project:</h4>
          <ol>
            <li style="padding-bottom: 20px">I'm now confident with using HTML and CSS. I also understand how JavaScript works and for what kind of functions it is used. </li>
            <li style="padding-bottom: 20px">This project helped me understand much better how to design a <b>responsive website</b>. Knowing the role of columns and rows in different viewports (and how to define them) was a valuable learning that will help me in my design work.</li>
            <li style="padding-bottom: 20px">I can say that I have a completely new understanding of the relationship between design and development, and I feel much <b>more confident to talk to developers</b> about my designs after the course. I can also in a whole new way take into consideration the work of the developers when Iâ€™m making my designs. </li>
</ol>
            <p>As a UX Designer my aim is not to start writing code myself and building websites but I do find that it is extremely important to be able to speak the same language as developers and understand what restrictions and possibilities there are when it comes to translating wireframes to actual products.</p>
