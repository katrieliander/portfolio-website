            <p class="blue">A little bit about me</p>
<p>I'm originally from Finland but my desire for new adventures brought me to Berlin 3 years ago. My curiosity has taken me all around the world and so far I have lived in 5 countries. It's finally in Berlin where I dared to make my career transition into UX Design.</p>
<p>My first coffee in the morning, good food, sunsets, long walks, yoga, exploring new places and conversations with friends are things that bring me joy in my everyday life.</p>

<p class="blue"> Why UX Design?</p>
<p>Since I was little I have been interested in human behavior and in understanding why people act the way they do. My mum says that I didn't stop asking "why" when I was a child. </p>
<p>In my previous roles I had several touch points with UX design, and I've always felt drawn to issues related to usability. So when I started learning more about the field, I immediately felt like it was the right match for me. I love how UX design perfectly combines creative and analytical work.</p>

<p class="blue">How does my background strengthen me as a UX Designer?</p>
  <p>I studied Economics and Marketing, whereafter I worked +5 years in SEO, mainly in the e-commerce field. SEO is about driving traffic to a website but after all, it's all about providing a good user experience. </p><p>As a SEO specialist, I have been optimizing landing pages to provide relevant search results for users' search queries, reduced image sizes to speed up websites and made sure HTML elements are semantically correct - all of which are equally relevant and important for UX design. Together these two practices help shape digital products that bring value for both the user and the business.</p>
  </div>
      <div class="col-md-6 col-lg-6">
        <p class="blue">What I can bring</p>
      <p>I combine my expertise in design and marketing to help grow digital products and enhance user experience. I bring strategic problem-solving skills that tackles problems both from the perspective of the user and the business.
         <p>As a designer, I'm motivated by people - I wish to design digital experiences that have a positive impact on people's lives and that solve real-life problems.</p>
