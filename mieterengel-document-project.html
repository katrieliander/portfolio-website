              <p>MieterEngel helps tenants solve rental problems online. Members gets access to the MieterEngel portal where they can directly connect with their personal lawyer and ask questions to any rental problem.</p>

              <p> The consultation flow starts with the customer submitting a question in the customer portal. The customer is required to type a message and often the lawyer needs some case related documents as well e.g. rental contract, utility bill, termination letter. The customer can either upload existing files/images or take photos of documents with the camera function in the web app and upload them that way. </p>
              <p>The service team reviews the request and if some important documents are missing, the customer is asked to upload these before the message is forwarded to the lawyer.</p>

        <h3>Problem statement</h3>
        <p>The initial problem statement came from our internal service team:</p>
        <p>”Often <b>important documents are missing</b> from customer’s questions which leads to much back and forth between the customer and the service team. Another problem is that customers very often upload single images that we need to merge before forwarding the message to the lawyer. These steps are <b>time consuming</b> for us and also result in <b>longer waiting times for the customers</b>.”</p>
        <h3>Existing (old) user flow for document upload</h3>
<p> Below you can see the existing document upload flow in the customer app on mobile. The same logic applied for desktop. The upload flow differed slightly for customers that submitted their first question because in that case the rental contract was required as well. The customer was in that case unable (CTA disabled) to submit the message without attaching the rental contract.

              <h4>Findings from service team</h4>
              <p><b>Problem 1: Single image uploads by customers </b></p>
              <p>The main source for this problem we could verify immediately. The problem with the normal upload function is that each file/image selected (most often from the phone’s camera roll) is uploaded separately. This can lead to customer messages with up to 50 single images attached. The service team then has to merge these images together to documents that make sense for the lawyer.</p>
              <p><b>Problem 2: Important documents missing from customer questions</b></p>
              <p>At this stage we could only make assumptions why customers didn't upload needed documents. Our guesses were that they might either forget or that they are not aware that they should attach these documents.</p>
            </div>
<h4>Customer research</h4>
            <p>The next step after discussing and getting insights from the service team was to do customer research in order to identify the root of the problem. This phase included several steps in both qualitative & quantitative research:
              <ul>
                <li><b>Hotjar recordings</b> to see how customers behave on the document upload screens.</li>
                <li><b>Customer calls</b> to interview customers that had just recently uploaded either single images or submitted a question without the needed documents. The goal was to understand why the customer had acted this way. </li>
                <li><b>Tracking with Google Analytics and Tag Manager</b> to understand the ratio of uploads on different devices (desktop vs. mobile) and method (upload vs. camera app). This helped to understand behavior and problems across devices.</li>
                <li><b>Actual customer data</b> - we went through +150 customer cases to get a further understanding of actual customer behavior.</li>
                  </ul>
<h4>Main insights from customer research</h4>
<p>The main findings from the quantitative and qualitative research are below. The research confirmed that the main issues were missing documents and single image uploads. Missing individual pages (e.g. from rental contracts) turned out to be almost as big of a problem as entire documents missing. </p>
  <p>The quantitative research was important in order to identify the problem(s) that needed most urgently a fix.</p>

              <p>During the ideation phase we explored multiple versions and ideas that aimed to solve the main problems of missing documents/pages and single image uploads. Below some of the early versions and wireframes.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>We explored with the idea of a <b>funnel model</b> that would change the user flow so that all users would have to go through the document upload screen. On this screen they could also then see the document categories and identify the most common documents that are needed for their topic. This would work as a trigger for users to upload files. Alternatively they could make a concious decision not to upload anything.</li>
          <li><b>New document screen with categories</b> that would display the most common documents and help user to understand what documents might be needed.</li>
        </ul>

              <div class="narrow margin-bottom-double">
                <h4>Review and testing </h4>
                <p> After the ideation phase, we presented and reviewed three different user flows with stakeholders. We had named the versions as <b>MVP, MVP+ and MVP++</b> based on our estimation on the implementation effort. We also did some user testing with our service team and made a couple small changes based on their feedback. </p>
                <p>Our tech team gave us feedback about the technical feasability and detailed effort for the different options. This allowed us to <b>evaluate the options based on their effort and estimated impact</b>. The funnel solution turned out to be technically very hard to implement with the existing system and therefore we had to deprioritize that idea.</p>
<p>From the different iterations we identified, however, some valuable components that we wanted to have in the new user flow:</p>
<p><b>1. Categories for documents</b></p>
  <p>Display document categories that will depend on the rental problem topic. This will help service team to organize files and it helps the customer to know what documents are needed.</p>
<p><b>2. Make users confirm that they don't have any documents to upload</b></p>
  <p>Make the user make a conscious decision that they in fact don't want to upload any documents. This way it's less likely that users simply forget to upload.</p>
<p><b>3. Infom customer that all pages of a document are needed</b></p>
  <p>Some kind of component to inform and remind the customer that all pages of a document should be uploaded - not just a few pages.</p>
  <p><b>4. Merge single uploaded images</b></p>
  <p> As one of the most time-consuming tasks for the service team was to manually download and merge uploaded images, a solution to automatically merge images that are uploaded together needed to be implemented.</p>

<p>Below is the new final document upload flow in the customer app. Due to technical and time constraints we had to compromise on some things but the final solution still managed to improve the upload flow significantly.</p>

<h4>Change #1 to reduce the single image uploads</h4>
<p>Before all the images that the user selected and uploaded from their camera roll or laptop were individually uploaded as single files. These files were also often missing names as customers forgot to name them.</p>
<p>Now when user selects multiple images, these are automatically merged into one single PDF. Based on the category, a name is also automatically generated for the document.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="col-lg-6">
<h4>Change #2 to solve the issue of missing documents</h4>
<p> For each rental topic (e.g. mold, utility bill, deposit) we identified together with the service team the most common documents. These are now displayed on the screen which helps customers to identify which documents might be needed for their case and it also works as a reminder for them to upload these.</p>
<p> For some topics the lawyer nearly always needs specific documents, for example photos of reported defect. Therefore, we added a popup with the logic that it will only be displayed if the user submits their defect-related question without having uploaded a file under the category "Photos of defect". In other cases this popup is not displayed to avoid annoying users.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row margin-bottom-double">
    <div class="col-lg-6">
<h4>Change #3 to encourage users to upload all pages of a document</h4>
<p>Another issue was missing individual pages mostly in rental contracts. Now when users are about to upload their contract, they will see a popup that informs them to upload all pages and make sure that they are readable. User has to confirm by clicking "Understood" in order to proceed.</p>
